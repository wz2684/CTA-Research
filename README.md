# CTA-Research

## Research Project Commissioned by Haitong Futures

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks documenting the research workflow, experimental design, and empirical findings related to CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) factor modeling and tree-based methods.

The primary purpose of this repository is to walk through the research process. The notebooks are written to reflect research reasoning, intermediate diagnostics, and conclusions, rather than production-ready deployment code.

## Code & Data Availability

The repository is not intended to be fully self-contained.

Certain:

data sources

factor libraries

modeling utilities

are intentionally omitted.

Additional code or data may be provided upon request, subject to internal approval and usage constraints.

## Usage Notes
Results shown in notebooks may depend on:

proprietary data

internal preprocessing logic

controlled research environments

Reproducing results outside the original environment is not guaranteed.
